# Chapter List

- [x] Chapter 0
  - from 0.9:
    > Add `-ggdb` to the command line when debugging and `-O2 -DNDEBUG` for
    > release builds. Use the former for now.
  - from 0.10:
    > You can disable compiler extensions by adding the -pedantic-errors flag
    > to the compile command line.
  - from 0.11:
    > Add the following flags to your command line: `-Wall` `-Weffc++` `-Wextra`
    > `-Wconversion` `-Wsign-conversion`
    > 
    > Add the following flag to your command line to treat your warnings as
    > errors: `-Werror`
    > 
    > ## best practices
    > Don’t let warnings pile up. Resolve them as you encounter them (as if
    > they were errors). Otherwise a warning about a serious issue may be lost
    > amongst warnings about non-serious issues.
    > 
    > Turn your warning levels up to the maximum, especially while you are
    > learning. It will help you identify possible issues.
    > 
    > Enable “Treat warnings as errors”. This will force you to resolve all
    > issues causing warnings.  
  - from 0.12:
    > For GCC/G++/Clang, you can use compiler options `-std=c++11`, `-std=c++14`,
    > `-std=c++17`, `-std=c++20`, or `-std=c++23` (to enable C++11/14/17/20/23
    > support respectively). If you have GCC 8 or 9, you’ll need to use
    > `-std=c++2a` for C++20 support instead. You can also try the latest code
    > name (e.g. `-std=c++2c`) for experimental support for features from the
    > upcoming language standard.
